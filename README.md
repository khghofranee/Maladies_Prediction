--Introduction
Predicting the risk of diseases such as diabetes and heart disease can be crucial for early intervention and prevention. This project aims to provide predictive models that can assist healthcare professionals in assessing an individual's risk based on their health indicators.

--Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the models is sourced from [insert dataset source]. It contains anonymized patient data including demographic information, medical history, and diagnostic measurements.

--Features
The features used for predicting diabetes and heart disease include:

Age
Gender
Body Mass Index (BMI)
Blood pressure
Cholesterol levels
Glucose levels
Family history of the disease
Other relevant health metrics 

--Models
Two main types of machine learning models are implemented for prediction:

Diabetes Prediction Model: This model predicts the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on their health metrics.
Heart Disease Prediction Model: This model predicts the risk of an individual developing heart disease based on their health indicators.
Both models are trained using supervised learning techniques and evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
